🧠 Problem Summary

You’re given an unsorted array nums and an integer target.
Return indices (0-based this time) of the two numbers that add up to target.

✅ Each input has exactly one solution
✅ You can’t reuse the same element twice

Example:

Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9  
Output: [0, 1]
